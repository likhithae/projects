# PROJECTS

# Condition-Monitoring-in-Hydraulic-System
Given sensor readings of 17 sensors used by the hydraulic test rig that quantify the machineâ€™s health, the objective is to present classification-based methods for inferring condition variables such as cooler condition, internal pump leakage and hydraulic accumulator from the sensor data streams.

# Leaf Disease Identification and Detection  
Classification of leaf diseases on a real world data set using machine learning algorithms.
Developed an interactive platform to upload a leaf image, detect if it is healthy or diseased and identify the type of disease. 
Enhanced the given image, divided it into four clusters and extracted the essential features. Trained the classification models with an accuracy of 80% by using the extracted features.

# Quick Well
A web application to book online appointment with doctor or for lab tests, purchase medicines, keep track of all patient records and post health tips daily.

# Student Academic Performance Prediction                                                                                                
Developed a ML model to predict student performance based on academic and demographic factors, achieving 92% accuracy and providing actionable insights by identifying the factors affecting student performance.
Utilized a dataset of 4,400 student records, preprocessed the data, and employed supervised learning with decision trees, svm, knn, naive bayes, and logistic regression.

# Airbnb
The purpose of the website is to provide an online property management system, where the users can search for properties and make reservations for the required dates according to the availability of the properties. The user can also sign up as a host if he wants to list a property.
Users can register themselves with the cozy crib. The registered users can view their account, edit their details, add properties to their favourites list, rate a property and make reservations.
The Host can list a property, edit its details and also delete the property.
