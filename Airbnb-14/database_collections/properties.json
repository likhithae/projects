We are a working farm, so expect chickens pecking around the yard, our big Great Pyrenees Moose meeting you at the drive, and the horse begging for some treats! There is a cozy fire pit out back and you also have a private driveway entrance with covered boat parking available upon request. The cottage features two large bedrooms with walk-in closet, full kitchen with appliances and a nice bathroom with bathtub/shower combo. The living room has a queen sized sofa bed. The decor is country cute and cozy. The bedroom is very spacious with a television located in the armoire, as well as a large HD Roku TV in the living room.\n                ",

The composting bathroom is 20 feet away and the shower house a short walk. Water is supplied as the Moose Haven is a dry cabin. The remoteness, views, ability to have pets make this spot special.
